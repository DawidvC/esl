These files comprise the ESL compiler front-end.  The back end is LLVM.

To bootstrap a ESL front-end on an x86 or x86-64 Linux system:

1. Install LLVM, let the directory in which the executables "llc" and "opt"
   reside be DIR.

2. The gcc development system must also be installed, only the assembler,
   linker, and, lowlevel libraries are used.

3. cd src/

4. In the shell file "llvm", edit the variable "LLVM" to reflect where the
   LLVM programs installed in step 1 reside (i.e., DIR).

   In the Makefile edit the variable "ESLCFLAGS" to indicate which release
   of LLVM will be used.  This is necessary because the LLVM intermediate
   representation (IR) changed in non-backward compatible way with
   release 3.7.0.
   The Makefile should be edited if you are not building on a supported
   host architecture.  If you are targeting the compiler to run on a different
   architecture than the host, then you are on your own.

5. Type "make"
   If successful, identical copies of a the compiler are left in
   "eslc2" and "eslc3"
